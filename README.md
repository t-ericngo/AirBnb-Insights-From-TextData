# Keeping Your Renters Happy: An Analysis of AirBnb Ratings & Customer Reviews
### Intro
AirBnb is now one of the most popular lodging websites for travelers across the world. As an accommodation platform, Airbnb relies heavily on customers’ feedback to inform other customers’ decision on where to stay. However, much of the dynamics that shape customer reviews and ratings are unclear. In this project, we investigate patterns in customer reviews and factors influencing customer feedback - both in numeric ratings and written reviews - using text analytic methods (sentiment analysis, word clouds, two-mode text networks) and statistical models (simultaneous regression). We use these analytical tools to compare these patterns across Bangkok and San Francisco – two major metropolitans and tourist destinations of the world.

### Overall findings & insights:
* Common intuitions are confirmed:
  * Listings (lodgings) with good/helpful hosts, good location, and clean and comfortable space invite more positive customer feedback (both numeric and text reviews)
* The way hosts advertise about not only their properties but also themselves also matters. Particularly, hosts with positive introductions/biographies & positive neighborhood descriptions tend to receive higher customer ratings and more positive reviews.
* Some inherent difference of Airbnb reviews in Bangkok and San Francisco are revealed:
  * Bangkok's districts can be divided into three explicitly clear clusters based on the level/amount of material features that their Airbnb listings possess (e.g., good locations or premium amenities). 
  * San Francisco has notably more clusters that are overlapping and tend to have a more distinct qualitative characteristics or “vibes”. In other words, Airbnb guests in Bangkok appear to care more about the features & services available, whereas travelers in San Francisco seem to focus more on cultural features of the properties in their reviews.
